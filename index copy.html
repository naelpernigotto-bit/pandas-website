        <h2 id="origin">Origin of Pandas</h2>
    <div id="container">
        <p class="p1">Pandas are native to the mountainous regions of central China, primarily in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. 
            They have lived in these bamboo forests for thousands of years, evolving to survive on a diet almost entirely made up of bamboo. 
            Their unique black-and-white fur not only makes them easily recognizable but also provides camouflage in the dense forests. 
            Pandas are solitary animals, and their quiet nature helps them avoid predators. 
            Over the centuries, they have become one of the most beloved and symbolic animals in the world, representing wildlife conservation efforts globally.</p>

             <h2 id="Habitat">Where do they live</h2>
             <p class="p2">Pandas live in cool, wet mountain forests in central China, usually at elevations between 1,200 and 3,100 meters. 
             These forests are dense with bamboo, which provides both food and shelter. 
            The thick vegetation protects pandas from predators and harsh weather while giving them areas to roam freely. 
            In recent years, conservation efforts such as protected reserves and wildlife corridors have helped pandas expand and connect their habitats, giving them a better chance to survive in the wild. 
            Despite these efforts, pandas remain vulnerable, and their natural habitat is still under threat from deforestation and human activity.</p>

    <div class="third">
        <h2 id="nutrition">What do they eat</h2>
        <p class="p3">Pandas mostly eat bamboo, which makes up almost 99% of their diet. They have strong jaws and special molars that allow them to crush tough bamboo stalks.
             A single panda can eat up to 12–15 kilograms of bamboo each day! Occasionally, they may eat small rodents, birds, or other plants, but bamboo remains their main source of nutrition. 
             Pandas spend most of their day eating and resting to digest the large amounts of food they consume.
             Their slow metabolism and peaceful lifestyle make this diet sustainable for their species.</p>

    <div class="fourth">
        <h2 id="behavior_fun_facts">Behaviors & Fun Facts</h2>
        <p class="p4">Pandas are calm and playful animals, often seen rolling or climbing in their natural habitat. 
            They have a “pseudo-thumb,” an extended wrist bone that functions like a thumb, which helps them grasp bamboo easily. 
            Baby pandas are tiny, blind, and completely dependent on their mothers for the first few months of life. 
            Despite their size, pandas are excellent climbers and swimmers, which helps them explore their environment safely. 
            Interestingly, pandas communicate with each other through vocalizations, scent markings, and body language. 
            These unique behaviors make pandas fascinating creatures and beloved icons of wildlife conservation worldwide.</p>
